YukiSkye_x0 Channel Docs
=========================

Why does Skylar have documentation?
-----------------------------------

Well, Phat has docs, and I steal all his good ideas.

Where can I watch the streams?
------------------------------

On Twitch, duh? I assume that's how you got here. But it's over at https://twitch.tv/YukiSkye_x0

You can also join the Struggle Bus Discord_ for the latest in Podcast News and  and random memes

Last but not least, how about following on Twitter_ or Instagram_?

Ideas or Suggestions?
---------------------

I am always open to making the stream better and adding new things to it! Feel free to let me know either view DM in Discord_ or shoot me an Email_
