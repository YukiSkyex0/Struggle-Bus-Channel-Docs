Phat32 Channel Docs
===================

Why does Phat have documentation?
---------------------------------

Well, I am a Software Developer and wanted to make sure all the things people can do to the stream are accessible to everyone to see what they can do! Plus I am also lazy and wanted an easy way to update when I add new things.

Where can I watch the streams?
------------------------------

That would be over on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/Phat32

You can also join the Discord_ for the latest in whats happening and random memes

Last but not least, how about following on Twitter_ or Instagram_?
